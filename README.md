## Python Environments Used

### **Environment 1 — HSMSEO**
Used for:
- Week 1 Activities
- Week 2 recursion tasks
- Debugging tasks
- Generating `requirements.txt`

### **Environment 2 — Income Tax Environment **
Used to:
- Show the Income Tax Calculator running in a fresh environment  
- Demonstrate environment isolation
